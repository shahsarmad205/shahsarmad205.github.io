    <section id="About">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, My name is Sarmad Shah, a Computer Science and Applied Mathematics student at Suffolk University, Boston.
            I started my bachelor’s degree in 2023 and am set to graduate by December 2026.
            I have a strong passion for software development, algorithms, and problem-solving, with a particular focus on backend engineering and system optimization.
            Currently, I’m working on building the backend for a Performance Marketing App using Java Spring Boot and Python, combining my expertise in both software engineering and mathematical modeling to create efficient and scalable solutions.
            Beyond academics and coding, I have demonstrated strong leadership and teamwork abilities, earning the Sportsman of the Year award for my dedication to team management and leadership in sports.
            As an international student from Pakistan, I bring a diverse perspective, adaptability, and a problem-solving mindset to every challenge I take on.
            I am always open to new opportunities, collaborations, and discussions about technology, finance, and innovation. Let’s connect!
        </p>
